Set of capabilities deliveries
- does x
- does y

Set of quality level
1.  - some working functionality ... so it can be demonstrated and reasoned about

2.  - some working functionality ... so it can be demonstrated and reasoned about
    - checked into source control ... so it can be reproduced for different customers 

3.  - some working functionality ... so it can be demonstrated and reasoned about
    - checked into source control ... so it can be reproduced for different customers 
    - deployed as packages ... so it can be deployed for different customers

4.  - some working functionality ... so it can be demonstrated and reasoned about
    - checked into source control ... so it can be reproduced for different customers 
    - deployed as packages ... so it can be deployed for different customers
    - is supported by tests ... so it can be changed with confidence to support multiple customers
    
5.  - some working functionality ... so it can be demonstrated and reasoned about
    - checked into source control ... so it can be reproduced for different customers 
    - deployed as packages ... so it can be deployed for different customers
    - is supported by tests ... so it can be changed with confidence to support multiple customers
    - is supported by test which demonstrate ability to data failures ... so customers percive a robust system

6.  - some working functionality ... so it can be demonstrated and reasoned about
    - checked into source control ... so it can be reproduced for different customers 
    - deployed as packages ... so it can be deployed for different customers
    - is supported by initial tests ... so it can be changed with confidence to support multiple customers
    - is supported by test which demonstrate ability to data failures ... so customers percive a robust system
    - is documented ...  so it can be picked understood by the customer

7.  - some working functionality ... so it can be demonstrated and reasoned about
    - checked into source control ... so it can be reproduced for different customers 
    - deployed as packages ... so it can be deployed for different customers
    - is supported by initial tests ... so it can be changed with confidence to support multiple customers
    - is supported by test which demonstrate ability to data failures ... so customers percive a robust system
    - is documented ...  so it can be picked understood by the customer
    - is supported by test which demonstrate ability to hande infrastructure failures ... so it wont be expensive to support

8.  - some working functionality ... so it can be demonstrated and reasoned about
    - checked into source control ... so it can be reproduced for different customers 
    - deployed as packages ... so it can be deployed for different customers
    - is supported by initial tests ... so it can be changed with confidence to support multiple customers
    - is supported by test which demonstrate ability to data failures ... so customers percive a robust system
    - is documented ...  so it can be picked understood by the customer
    - is supported by test which demonstrate ability to hande infrastructure failures ... so it wont be expensive to support
    - can be adjusted by a 'public' interface ... so it can support additional functionality variation
