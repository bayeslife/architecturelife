# Team Niche Ideation

The following are all techniques hopefully to surface ideas

##  Might our niche be a UPI  (rather than a capability)?

UPI stands for *User - Problem - Impact*

Our niche could be 
- some specific users
- some problems

Possible UPI Niches

```
Users: External companies 
Problem: Need resources to develop solution
Impact:  Unable to achieve internal goals
```
But this is not very defined


```
Users: External product companies 
Problem: Need resources to deliver solutions based on their products
Impact:  Unable to acheive product goals
```
Again not very defined

```
Users: External companies 
Problem: Need resources to analyze data
Impact:  Unable to acheive insights
```
Again not very defined


```
Users: Company staff 
Problem: Need systems which provide continuous visibility and insight into asset performance with respect to systems.
Impact:  Decisions have to be made with bad (out of date, incorrectly presented) information
```
This is about right I would think.  Its about gathering, processing, presentating information.


##  What should we be experts in?

Which of these we could put onto the team CV.

Experts in:
- in integration to gather data from enterprise systems (PI, ERP)
- in integration to combine data from different sources
- in processing to detect (enrich, filter, cleanse, learn) insights from data 
- in creating insight portals
    - via defined paradigm to deliver a dashboard
- in estimating how much a solution will cost
    - by using the same paradigm for each delivery
- in costs in developing/running a solution
    -Azure, GCP, Aws, IBM Costs
- in making each next delivery a modification of a previous delivery
    - delivery by addition
- how to present the state of the system development
    - backlog
    - issues

## What should we harvest/gather/retain from our projects to our next projects

```
how-to
```
- but how-to gets old quickly

```
stuff which is common from project to project but different from other system integration work
```
- UI controls
- pipeline
- comparison schema
- data processing pipeline models
    - event detection
```
how to present data
```
- when to use histograms
- when to use confusion matrix
- when to use scatterplot
- how to display location

```
stories
``` 
- are these valueable
- are they generic enough


```
data on
```
- what the solution costs ...but this gets old quickly
- what are the type of Field Data and types of Event
    - what are the domain

```
processing data 
```
- detection
    - detection of the asset
    - detection of asset commercial performance/non performance
    - detection of anomolies of asset versus system performance

## What stuff could we retain (and bring to other projects) from project X
 
```
Coates Hire
``` 
- permissions - q1,provider,customer,customer user
- kubernetes use
- asset representation (serial number, asset)
- hire representation
- representing field data and combining into events
- notification
- library development
- use of event hub
- microservice

```
MineQ
```
- permissions - q1,provider,customer,customer user
- micro services
- asset representation
- device concept (device type)
- measurements vs events
- representing field data and combining into events
- notification
- reporting components
