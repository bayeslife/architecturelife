# Information Technology Plan

Every information project which delivers some capability needs a plan.

The following represents a high level view for what an architecture capability should normally entail

## Significant Plan Deliverables

### Level 1
- MVP : To get real feedback
- Awareness : Portal, Describing what exists and is coming
- Registering Users : Can users who would like to get access...request access
- Identity Stories/Affordances for the data/platform : What are 2 or 3 things a user could do with the platform
- Success Measurements : What measurements of success for the MVP. (which users, which data, what activities)
- Authorization : What workable authorization provisioning needs to be in place for MVP (sufficient but not inhibiting to target audience) 
- Support: Can user issues with the system be recorded and triaged  (could be through conversations and a spreadsheet)

### Level 2
- Alpha Program : To get real feedback but from subset of users
- Discovery : Beyond static content, how do users find/search what is available 
- Self Registering Users : Is the onboarding process hands off/efficient from an end user point of view
- Identity Stories/Affordances for the data/platform : What are 2 or 3 things a user could additionally do with the platform
- Success Measurements : What measurements of success for the next deliverables are there. (which users, which data, what activities)
- Authorization : What workable authorization provisioning needs to be in place for these next stories
- Support: Can user issues with the system be recorded and triaged  (could be through conversations and a spreadsheet)
 
### Level 3
- Beta Program : To make it operational (cost viable)
- Discovery : Can new source of data be added with minimal effort 
- Self Registering Users : Is there hands off self service access 
- Identity Stories/Affordances for the data/platform : What are 2 or 3 things a user could additionally do with the platform
- Success Measurements : What measurements of success for the next deliverables are there. (which users, which data, what activities)
- Authorization : What workable authorization provisioning needs to be in place for these next stories
- Monitoring: How will it be measured if users are using and coming back to the service
- Support: Can user issues with the system be reported, recorded and triaged (could be saas provider)

### Level 4
- General Availability : To make it widely available to intended beneficiaries
- Discovery : Where will this capablity be advertized to promote it to intended audience
- Success Measurements : What rate of takeup is acceptable and how will this be measured.
- Monitoring : How will the availability of the solution be measured and reported
- Security: How to associate users with permissions to allow differentiated access
- Support: Can user issues with the system be recorded and triaged

### Level 5
- Maintaining the service : To make it widely available while changes are made
- Discovery : Where do users see new data,features
- Testing: How will testing be performed to ensure platform features are continuing to work under change
- Success Measurements : What rate of takeup is acceptable and how will this be measured.
- Support: Can user issues with the system be recorded and triaged
