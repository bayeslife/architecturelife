# Expressions related to the value of architecture.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPP7Bleg214) is a provocative video of a talk by James Coplien who is generally anti agile and anti test driven design.  His point is that it is important to get deep context (knowledge) of a problem domain in order to build effective solutions.  He is in favour of planning, architects who code, coders having familiarity with HCI concepts (Fitts law for example) and focus on improving business skills.

[Role of Archtiture Owner in Disciplined Agile](http://disciplinedagiledelivery.com/the-dad-role-of-architecture-owner/)
The responsibilities of the architecture owner include:
- Guiding the creation and evolution of the architecture of the solution that the team is working on.  Note that the architecture owner is not solely responsible for the architecture, but that they lead the technical discussions.
- Mentoring and coaching other team members in architecture practices and issues.
- Working closely with the Enterprise Architecture team, and often being a member of it, to understand and evolve the architectural direction and standards of your organization.
- Ensuring that the team adheres to the architectural direction and standards of your organization.
- Understanding existing enterprise assets such as frameworks, patterns, subsystems and ensuring that the team uses them where appropriate.
- Ensuring that the solution will be easy to support by encouraging good design and refactoring to minimize technical debt.
- Ensuring that the solution is integrated and tested on a regular basis, ideally via the practice of continuous integration(CI).
- Having the final say regarding technical decisions, but they try to avoid dictating the architectural direction in favor of a collaborative, team-based approach. The architecture owner should work very closely with the team lead to identify and determine strategies to mitigate key project technical risks.
- Leads the initial architecture envisioning effort at the beginning of the project and supports the initial requirements envisioning effort (particularly when it comes to understanding and evolving the non-functional requirements for the solution).
