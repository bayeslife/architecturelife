# Expressions related to the value of architecture.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPP7Bleg214) is a provocative video of a talk by James Coplien who is generally anti agile and anti test driven design.  His point is that it is important to get deep context (knowledge) of a problem domain in order to build effective solutions.  He is in favour of planning, architects who code, coders having familiarity with HCI concepts (Fitts law for example) and focus on improving business skills.
