
## Why not a workflow based sytem



This is not workflow because
- workflow is to prescriptive and reduces options whereas events based system allow to continued optimiziation and flexibility into the future
- workflow does not support decomposition.  Breaking a problem down into multiple sub problems which are independently solved.
- workflow requirements top down control of the functionality and requires perfect know of all interactions required.  
- workflow is orchestaton while events based systems are choreography
- workflow is presecriptive vs reactive
    - suggestion is that prescription only works in very mature level implementation (Maturity levels 4 or 5)
- workflow requires definition of workflow boundaries - unless they are very good reasons for those boundaries there can be restrictive and artificial.
- when there has not been any real world use of the functionalty workflow is overly restrictive
- workflows are harder to test as they involve composition of many functions, events are pure functions
- an event based model provides
    - more flexibility
    - less holelistic knowledge to support changes
