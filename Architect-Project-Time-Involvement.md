#  How much time is required for systems architecture in a project 

While the answer will vary from project to project the following is worthy of consideration.

## Activities

The architect expects to be involved in the following activities
- analysis
    - reviewing current capabilities
    - reviewing current market offerings
    - prototypes
    - work breakdown structures
    - model development
    - understanding requirements
    - describing solution options
- communication
    - communicating options
    - gathering non functional viewpoints into the solution
    - tradeoffs
    - scope of stories and releases
- approach
    - review issues, risks
    - getting buy in
    - priortizing
- delivery
    - design documentation
    - API contracts
    - training sessions
    - system tests
- sheparding
    - Code reviews
    - Standups

## Perspectives to be reviewed

The architect considers many aspects of a solution including
- testability 
    - test data
    - tools to support testing
- security
    - authentication
    - authorization
    - confidentiality
    - integrity
- patterns
    - libraries
- information model
    - information entities and their relationships
- billable
    - ability to charge for service use
- performance
    - response time
    - throughput
- standardization
    - applicable standards
    - scope of standard alignment
- buildability - 
    - CI/CD
- scaleability 
    - ability to handle load
- cost efficiency 
    - resource utilization (development and operational)
- deployability - ability to make ongoing changes
- licensing 
- reporting 
- solution value
    - analytics gathering

## Parties

The systems architect needs to involve with the following project roles
- Business Analyst/Production Owners
    - working to form and understand requirements
    - identifying dependencies delivery functionality and underlying capability delivery 
    - defining stories and sub tasks
    - planning work / managing the backlog 
    - prioritizing work
- Developers and Dev Operations
    - Review work breakdown structure
    - Test creation
    - Code and Documentation Review
    - Define and Establish Patterns
- UX/UI 
    - Review designs
- Testers
    - Reviewing scope of stories and implementation
    - Review work priority
    - Review test cases
    - Review test results


The system architect needs to be involved with the following external roles
- Enterprise Architects 
    - Alignment to cross project strategies
- Vendors
    - Evaluation of options
- Independent Assessment
    - Security Assessment
    - Performance Assessment
- Shared Services
    - teams which can provide operatinal systems which the project team depends upon

## Ceremonies
The architect needs to remain current with work performed by a number of project members and should be involved in the following ceremonies
- standups
- grooming
- showcase

## Conclusions

- The architect may not need to be involved in the project full time but should be involved in an ongoing basis while the project is active.
- The architect generally needs to be available to the project team
- As the architect interacts with all project team members and provides guidance and know how on all aspects of the SLDC they should be involved in all phases of the project:  Inception, Construction and Transition phases.
- To remain current on a project with a full time scrum team the architect should
    - be engaged at least 50% of the time during the project
    - be engaged near 100% of the time during inception phases
    - ideally is engaged near 50-75% of the time during implementation but also operating at 25% as an additional developer to the project
    - during the transition phase ideally is engaged 50% of the time
